Hi Daisy,

Welcome once again to NexiqLabs! We are excited to see what you can bring to the team, and as your first task, we have something quite interesting for you.

Task:
We would like you to create a website that resembles our existing NexiqLabs site, but with more advanced features. Here’s what we’re looking for:

1. User Login System – Implement a secure login system for users.
2. Invoicing Feature – Allow users to generate and manage invoices.
3. Employee-Based Portal – A section for employees to log in and access internal resources.
4. Payment Gateway Integration – Link a payment gateway for clients to make payments easily. Please use our primary number 77377 70240 for the gateway setup.
5. Additional Advanced Features – Feel free to bring in any other innovative ideas that will make the site stand out.
   
This will be a part of a competition among the interns. The best website will be selected to go live as our official company website, and the winner will receive a certificate along with a development course related to the technology stack you use.

For Assistance: In case you need an OTP or any other technical support, feel free to reach out to your team leader, Mrs. Sara Khan, at sara.nexiqlabs@outlook.com.

We look forward to your submission and wish you the best of luck in this task!

Best regards,

Sara Khan
